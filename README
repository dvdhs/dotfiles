== David Suh's Personal dotfiles ==

1. Overview

This repo contains my personal dotfiles. It is meant to be used with GNU stow.

Usage:

git clone https://github.com/dvdhs/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
stow .

2. Notes

The repo should try to maintain maximum compatability with bash. The zshrc
largely just sources the bashrc, and most additions should try to stick to
being bash-compatible. It should be avoided using any zsh-specific conviniences
or features unless they are particularly neccessary; there is some branching due to shell differences in e.g. PS1 formats.
